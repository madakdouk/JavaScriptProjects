### Calculator
A basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript calculator. It does not have advanced calculator functionality, but it can carry out addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It can be cleared/reset and its display updates live as buttons are clicked.

### Tic-Tac-Toe
I created a web tic-tac-toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is played by 1 user against the computer. There are sound effects that play as an X or O are placed. A sound will also play to celebrate when a player wins, or to announce a tie game. Animation through JavaScript is used to draw a line through the winning letters.

### Pizza Menu
A basic web app that displays a pizza menu. Users can select a size and toppings. The application uses JavaScript to calculate a total price based on the selections that were made.

### To-do app
A very basic to-do application. Users can type in a task to add it to the to-do list and they are able to clear out any task with the press of a button. CSS styling is minimal and may be updated in the future.

### Portfolio Website
My portfolio website has been updated with JavaScript to include a slide show and a pop-up contact form!
